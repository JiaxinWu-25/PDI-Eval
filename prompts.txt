A camera following directly behind a blue delivery truck driving on a straight desert highway. The camera moves at the exact same speed as the truck, keeping the distance between them constant. The truck occupies the center 50% of the frame. The road markings and desert bushes on the side rush past quickly due to speed, creating a strong motion blur effect on the periphery, while the back of the truck remains sharp and static in size. Golden hour lighting, cinematic, 4k, 24fps, 6 seconds.
